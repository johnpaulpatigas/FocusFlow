# FocusFlow

FocusFlow is a productivity application designed to help users manage their tasks, track their focus sessions, and monitor their progress over time. It combines a task manager with a Pomodoro-style focus timer to enhance productivity and concentration.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: a frontend application and a backend API.

-   **/frontend**: A React-based single-page application that provides the user interface.
-   **/backend**: A Node.js and Express-based API that handles business logic and data persistence.

## Features

-   **Task Management**: Create, update, delete, and track tasks.
-   **Focus Timer**: A configurable timer to help users focus on tasks for specific periods.
-   **Progress Tracking**: Visualize progress and track completed tasks and focus sessions.
-   **User Profiles**: Manage user profiles and settings.

## Core Technologies

-   **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL
-   **Mobile**: Capacitor
